				in life. PRESS is an acronym Charles "MR." Cheeks III came up
				with during the infancy of his MMA career. His ex-coach and
				close friend Terry Parkman (also a youth pastor) helped him
				develop as a fighter, instructor, man, and Christian. It was
				during this time that PRESS Forward was born and implemented
				into Mr. Cheeks's MMA career, as well as his everyday life.`,
