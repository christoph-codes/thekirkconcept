			review: 'TKC has the vision and ability to create amazing large format visuals, graphic designs and print ready art. TKC also included layered art for Pantone Coated color matching. His designs are stunning, visually precise and on point. TKC’s best attribute, is the gift to provide clean and crisp designs which exceed 20′ heights and beyond. No pixelation, no jagged edges, no blurring… Highly recommend 5 out of 5 stars.',

They came back with many many choices to help me narrow down what I wanted. They were extremely timely and more than worth the money spent. I Am thrilled with my new company logo and am proud to display it! Would recommend TKC 10 times out of 10.',

			review: 'The Kirk Concept is very professional and has remarkable skills creating and originating brands and logos. My wife and I have both used TKC for our projects and we couldn’t be happier. The communication throughout the process was exactly what we were looking for, and the end result has blown everyone one away who’s seen them. We cannot thank TKC enough for legitimizing and bringing to life our brand ideas, and I look forward to seeing what he creates for our future projects. Thanks TKC!',
