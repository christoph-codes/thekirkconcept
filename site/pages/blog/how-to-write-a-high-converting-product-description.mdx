You should not take product descriptions lightly for a number of reasons. They help with website product page SEO, clarity, and readability. All factors that will convince your audience into making a purchase on your site! Take a look at these six points to piecing together the highest converting product description.

## 1. CUSTOMER CALLOUT/IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM

Every business who offers a product is providing a solution to a common problem. By presenting the problem, you are connecting with your potential customer and starting them on a journey toward presenting your solution to them.

Does that little cupholder in your car usually double as a phone holder?
When you go and grab your morning coffee that phone usually ends up on your seat. Just before it smashes into your dashboard and hits the floor when you slam on the brakes at the next red light.

## 2. PRESS ON THE CUSTOMER‚ÄôS PAIN POINT

So after identifying the customer‚Äôs problem, you must address their pain point. The best way to define this is the thing that would bother them the most about their problem. There can be one or many pain points. Just be sure to address all of the ones that your product will solve. Again, this presents a stage to present the solution in a way that convinces them to purchase.

Now you have a cracked phone and your struggling to pick it up off of the floor before the light turns green.
Not the start that you needed on an already stressful Monday morning commute.

## 3. PRESENT THE SOLUTION

YES! Now it is time to present your product and how it is the solution to the customer‚Äôs problem and pain points. Be sure to be straight to the point and how it can be used. You can also give them a sense of satisfaction once your product is being used.

That‚Äôs where our handy all in one Cup & Phone Holder comes into play. Fits perfectly into any car and props your phone up for easy to view directions.

## 4. JUSTIFY THE PRICE

Justifying the price is always a good practice for a high converting product description. If your product is $30, it becomes an easy sell when they could be paying a higher price for their problem, pain point, or even future pain point. Address this right after the solution so any doubts are removed early. Not to mention be able to enjoy your morning coffee without a $100 phone repair bill.

## 5. OFFER + SCARCITY

High converting product pages usually have some type of offer that you can explain. Usually, the offer might be just the price of the product, but if there is more that can be talked about to sell on top of the sell, don‚Äôt leave it out!
